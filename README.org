* Hache : running Axe in Docker

A simple demo that instantiates a headless Firefox in Docker and runs
an [[https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core][Axe]] audit on it, using the relevant [[https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-gems][axe gems]].

It needs https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-gems/pull/429 to work.

** Usage

#+begin_src sh
make up
#+end_src
